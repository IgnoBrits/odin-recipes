        <h2>BEST DAMN INSTANT POT PULLED PORK</h2>
        <p>This is the best damn pulled pork recipe i’ve ever made. Yes, you read that correctly. And it’s made in an
            Instant Pot electric pressure cooker!
            We start with a pork butt roast. You can get either bone-in or boneless. If you find ones that are
            vacuum packed and the packaging indicates that the pork contains a 12% solution, this means that the roast
            is brined. Those are the best to use. Meat is brined this way to maintain tenderness and juiciness. You can
            always make your own brine, but that’s a topic for another day. Go with the brined meat if you can. If the
            meat has a noticeable fat layer on it, you’ll want to cut that off. I generally like to use a roast that’s
            4lbs. I cut the meat into 4 pieces of equal size, cutting out the bone if it has one.

            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>½ tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 tbs Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp liquid smoke</li>
            <li>2 tbs olive oil</li>
            <li>½ – 1 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim fat from pork roast and cut into 4 same size chunks.</li>
            <li>Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk together. Add pork roast chunks to rub mix and coat
                well.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tbs olive oil to Instant Pot and set to saute. Once it indicates hot, add 2 pieces of the pork.
                Sear on each side for about 2 minutes each. Remove pork and set aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining
                pork pieces.</li>
            <li>Once pork is seared and removed from pot, press cancel and add ½ cup chicken broth. Use a wooden spoon
                and deglaze the bottom of the pot. Make sure to scrape up all the bits. Then add remaining chicken
                broth. Worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke.</li>
            <li>Place pork chunks directly into the liquid in the pot, spacing out as best possible. Secure lid and make
                sure vent is set to sealing. Pressure cook/manual on high pressure for 60 minutes.Then let pressure
                release naturally for 20 minutes or until pin drops.</li>
            <li>Remove pork to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks. Add your favorite BBQ sauce as desired. Or use the
                juice from the Instant Pot – it’s loaded with awesome flavor!</li>
